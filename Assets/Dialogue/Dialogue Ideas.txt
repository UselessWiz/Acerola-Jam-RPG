I'd love to be able to play the piano...
I'm so glad I dont have classes upstairs.
I wonder if there's anything in these drawers? - They're locked, so I can't check.
This level feels like a clone of downstairs.
I shouldn't be here... Good thing there's no teacher watching.
Weird things sometimes happen around here... - Maybe this place is haunted. That would be cool.
This place needs more windows.

Nothing exciting here :(
(Upon the door opening) That wasn't there before...

Where's the king gone?
This is such a weird place.
I shouldn't be here... I don't even know how I got here.
I feel like a knight... or maybe a princess.
These windows are so much cooler that the ones at school. - They've even got colours.

(Getting closer to the roof)
Do you know how we got here?
Can you tell me whats happening?

(On the roof)
There's nothing stopping you.
Just keep walking.
Maybe you'll remember this place in a few hours.
Maybe you'll remember me...
I doubt it though... No one seems to remember this place once they make it out.
:(

(No dialogue through grassland)

(School2 - more and more weird characters and things should be put into these dialogue lines as the player gets closer to the abberition.)
Hey, you made it back!
I remember you, but only just.
Do you know what happened to us?
At least everything is back now.
I must've had such a weird dream last night... It turned into a nightmare so fast.
I saw something so weird earlier, but I walked away and it's gone.
(Right outside the abberition room) FUCK!
(Inside the aberition room should exist about 30 empties with completely gibberish dialogue triggers)
